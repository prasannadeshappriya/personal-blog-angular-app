      This project was implemented while I was doing internship at Eyepax IT (Pvt)
      Ltd. The aim of this project is to reduce the time spending for the new employees to go through company policies,
      and related information. Employees can chat with this bot and found solution for there problems. New employees can
      get some understanding about company policies, culture, dress-code and extra activities while chat with this bot.
      [<b>Note:</b> This chat bot is still under development and not capable of performing its all commands. Latest
      release consists of most important policies of the company]
      <br>
      <br>
      There is a admin dashboard for the back-end to
      input data. Dashboard is consists of few administrative actions; Insert data to chat-bot's domain, edit and update
      them, Verify functionality of the chat-bot and broadcast message services. All the user input messages are processed
      by the server and send to the NLP library for extract the meaning and the actions need to be performed. After that,
      chat-bot will select the required information from the database and construct a meaning ful reply for the user.
      Usually, company planning events. Admin can insert the data regarding the event and send a broadcast message through
      the chat-bot. So that the employees can chat with the bot and clarify there doubts.

          "<span style="color: red">What are you capable of?</span>" instead of "<span
